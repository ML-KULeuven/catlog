## CatLog-Derivative trick
This repository contains the code and data generation for the experiments presented in the paper 
"Differentiable Sampling of Categorical Distributions Using the CatLog-Derivative Trick".

The two synthetic experiments can be found in [synthetic](ttps://github.com//ML-KULeuven/catlog/tree/master/synthetic).  
The code for our discrete variational auto-encoders is given in [DVAE](https://github.com//ML-KULeuven/catlog/tree/master/DVAE).  
The final neural-symbolic experiment is provided in [ADDITION](https://github.com//ML-KULeuven/catlog/tree/master/ADDITION).

More details about the experiments and their implementation is given in their respective folders.
