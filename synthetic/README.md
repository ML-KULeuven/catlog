## Synthetic Experiments
Both synthetic experiments are explained in more detail in their respective Jupyter notebooks. The comparison to the exact gradient in terms of bias and variance is given in [synthetic_gradients.ipynb](https://github.com/LennertDeSmet/CatLog/blob/master/synthetic/synthetic_gradients.ipynb)
while the synthetic optimisation task is provided in [synthetic_optimisation.ipynb](https://github.com/LennertDeSmet/CatLog/blob/master/synthetic/synthetic_optimisation.ipynb).
